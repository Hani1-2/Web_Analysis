    "               \"Color: 130 BUFF BEIGEVerified Purchase By far the best foundation I have ever used from a local drugstore. I have mild rosacea which can be hard to cover my redness. I do not like to use a bunch of products on my face and this is perfect! I'm a foundation, powder and blush type of girl. I will definitely switch from Revlon's ColorStay to this. I use NC35 from Mac's water based foundation, I use 300 Golden Beige in Revlon's ColorStay foundation and the BUFF BEIGE suits me perfectly. I was nervous because I read great reviews but many say the color changes which is true so I was scared to choose the wrong shade. I googled my butt off and couldn't find someone with my shade who also made the swap so I hope I help some fair skinned people out there. Lol.\", \"324 people found this helpful\"]\r\n",
