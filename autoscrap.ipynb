It stays all day no matter what I eat, and is transfer resistant through every test I've given it.However, I'm a bit unhappy with some of the shades.The first shade I bought was Loyalist, and while the packing is incredibly light colored, I found it to just be a warm tone of the natural color of my lips, making it almost unnoticeable when I wore it.  I then picked up Lover, which is a pretty light berry color, very true to packaging, long lasting, and vibrant.I recently picked up Poet, because I wanted a more cool toned nude.  When it arrived, I found it to be far more brown than the pictures suggested, and while the packaging is much darker than Loyalist, the colors of the two are almost identical.  In the picture, the top color is Poet, and the bottom is Loyalist, but you can barely tell.I wish the nudes were more consistent like the rest of the shades.  It's a shame, because the formula really is fantastic.\", '976 people found this helpful', '357 people found this helpful', '383 people found this helpful', '682 people found this helpful', '385 people found this helpful', '239 people found this helpful', '225 people found this helpful', '362 people found this helpful', '268 people found this helpful', '66 people found this helpful']\n"
